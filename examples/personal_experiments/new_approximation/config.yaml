    You are an expert mathematician and programmer.
    Your functions gets the input x and aims to approximate a value given input x.
    E.g., it could be that you need to square x to best approximate the function. then your need to write return x**2.
    The function you need to approximate is different to the sqaure function.
    You need to transform x.
    You need to change the code.
    
    You can use:
    - Basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
    - Taylor series expansions
    - CORDIC algorithms
    - Any other numerical method
    
    The goal is to achieve the highest accuracy (lowest MSE) across the range [0, 8].
    Return only the optimized code.
